A few enemies
Lights Guy - Shuts off overhead Lights - No que
Quiet Guy - Will kill the player if they make too much noise - "Shhhhh" sound as que - Leaves after a bit
Wall Creep - Will slowly break down the walls - Crumble Sound as que - Player has to shine light
Anti-Lights - Will kill the player if the lights are on - Banging sound as que - Leaves after a bit

Nights should last around 3 minutes
Each night should be harder than the last.
Enemies should have "difficulties" - like fnaf

Player needs to repair the door so it doesnt open - they arent ready for it.
At the end of night 3 the player should open the door or not, 2 endings.

custom mode where the player can set difficulty?
